<h2 id="section-whatisdrupal">What is Drupal? CMS Essentials</h2>

<p>Guilford College’s website is built with a content management system – or CMS – called Drupal. A CMS makes it possible for people without technical skills to create and edit pages, news articles, events and other content. If you’ve edited pages on Guilford College’s old site or used blogging platforms like Wordpress, then you’ve used a CMS.</p>

<p>Drupal is an open source product. A strong, dedicated community of developers from around the world contributes the code that makes Drupal run. There’s no cost to use it, and it is the platform of choice for organizations ranging from The Economist to The City of Austin, and Cisco to other colleges and universities. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<hr />

<h3>Content Types</h3>

<p>Often, when we’re on websites, everything seems like it’s just a page. But in Drupal, there are many different things that create a site. They’re called “content types.”</p>

<p>Content types are like containers that hold elements together.</p>

<p>For example, the elements of an article include a title, an image, a subtitle and body copy.</p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/content_type.png" alt="Content Types" />
<figcaption>Content Types</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Guilford College’s site includes custom content types like program created for the College’s academic degrees.</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>To see all content types that you can create, go to Manage &gt; Content &gt; Add Content</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Nodes</h4>

<p>Every piece of content on the site (a page, a video, a program, etc.) is called a node. When you’re editing the site, you’ll see the unique node ID in the browser’s URL bar. Something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://guilfordcollege.edu/node/116/edit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Site visitors never see this unique ID. Instead, they see standard URLs like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>http://guilfordcollege.edu/how-to-apply</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h4>Templates</h4>

<p>Templates pull all the elements of a content type into a visual look. They’re what visitors see when they come to the site. Guilford templates are designed to be highly flexible. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-components">Components: The Site&#8217;s Visual Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Components are the visual building blocks of the site’s templates. When you create content (e.g. page, program), you are given a variety of components to use. The available components, and the way you can arrange them, have been carefully thought out to balance flexibility with visual consistency across the site.</p>

<p>Consult the <a href="http://guilford-styleguide.area451.co/">Guilford Website Styleguide</a> to see the visual look of all website components and typographic elements. </p>

<p>Components are listed below in alphabetical order.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/accordion.jpg" alt="Accordion" />
<figcaption>Accordion</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Accordion</h4>

<p>Use the accordion component to create question and answer or FAQ sections. This component can also be used for any text you want content to expand and collapse. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Billboards</h4>

<p>Billboards — or “headers” — are built into the top area of certain content types, such as pages and events. Unlike other components, you won’t need to add billboards manually. Billboards may display an image, page title and call-to-action buttons. </p>

<figcaption>Billboard Profile</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="assets/billboard_events.png" alt="Billboard Events" />
<figcaption>Billboard Events</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>Calls to Action / CTAs</h4>

<p>Calls-to-action are available throughout the site. (CTAs are similar to the buttons on the old Guilford site.)</p>

<p>There are two types:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CTA buttons on headers and teasers</p></li>
<li><p>CTA cards</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use CTAs to inform users of the thing you want them to do next or learn more about.</li>
<li>Use CTAs contextually. For example, place an Apply CTA on a program page since that’s the likely next action users would want to take.</li>
<li>Do not overuse CTAs on a page or other content. If there are too many, they won&#8217;t stand out as important.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/factoid_block.png" alt="Factoid Block" />
<figcaption>Factoid Block</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Factoid</h4>

<p>Use the factoid component to highlight key facts about the College, a program or another topic relevant to the page. Include a short title — preferably one that in includes a number — and a longer description. Factoids do not include links.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/feed.png" alt="Example of Social Feed and News &amp; Event" />
<figcaption>Example of Social Feed and News &amp; Event</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Feeds</h4>

<p>Feeds are used to automatically pull information into special sections on pages. There are two kinds of feeds: News &amp; Events and Social.</p>

<hr />

<h4>News &amp; Events Feed</h4>

<p>The news &amp; event feed pulls news articles and events from Drupal and arranges them into a grid on the page. Choose from predefined categories to dictate what kind of news and events display.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Social Feed</h4>

<p>Social posts can be pulled from accounts in Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Follow the instructions to add accounts to the feed for each page.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Horizontal Rule</h4>

<p>Insert a horizontal rule to separate sections on a page. Rules can be the same width of the content or the full-width of the browsers.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>Two types of stand-alone images can be added to the page: content-width and screen-width. Content-width images include a caption or description. See the Image Specification section below for details.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/quote2.png" alt="Quotes" />
<figcaption>Quotes</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Quote</h4>

<p>Use the quote component to call out a brief quote by a student, professor, or other community member. </p>

<h4>Tip</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can call out quotations within the rich text component, too.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Rich Text</h4>

<figure>
<img src="assets/rich_text_front.png" alt="Rich text with images" />
<figcaption>Rich text with images</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rich text — or “body copy” — is useful when you need to present longer passages of text. The rich text component allows formatting such as heading styles to give your text hierarchy, making it easier for readers to follow. Bulleted lists, italics and bolding are also available. Use links embedded in the text to link to other pages, external sites, or documents like PDFs uploaded as media into Drupal.</p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/rich_text_front2.png" alt="Rich text being used with a quote" />
<figcaption>Rich text being used with a quote</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Media (images, image galleries, videos, profiles) can also be added to rich text. They will be inserted to the left or right, and your text will flow around it.</p>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use heading styles to structure your text. See below for reasons why and how to do it.</li>
<li>Be purposeful in using formatting tools such as bold and italics. They should add meaning rather than decoration.</li>
<li>Each rich text component can take one piece of media. If you want more than one piece of media to accompany a particular section of text, break the text into more than one rich text component.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Heading Styles</h4>

<figure>
<img src="assets/rich_text_header.png" alt="Annotated image of page with heading styles" />
<figcaption>Annotated image of page with heading styles</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When entering content into the rich text component you can use heading styles to format headings and subheadings for sections and paragraphs. Heading styles adjust the style of text and headings automatically so they remain consistent. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Do not use bold for headings and subheadings. Only use bold for emphasizing words or phrases in a sentence of body copy.</p>

<p>Headings are necessary because they: </p>

<ul>
<li>Give hierarchical structure and order to your information, making it more useful to users.</li>
<li>Are essential for accessibility; visitors using a screen reader need headings to understand the order of information.</li>
<li>Are important for SEO (search engine optimization).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>How to Add Headings</h4>

<ol>
<li>Highlight the text you want to make a heading.</li>
<li>Click the Format button and select the heading style you want to use. Note: The title of the page is a Heading 1 so you will want to use a Heading 2, 3 or 4 depending on if there is an intro teaser or other heading in another component already on the page. Be consistent with your heading styles across pages in a section of the site or tabs on content types like programs and departments.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h4>Smart Blocks</h4>

<p>The smart block component is available on the page content type. Smart blocks have the same fields as other common teaser blocks but look very different in design. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Stacks</h4>

<figure>
<img src="assets/stack_cards.png" alt="Sample of Card Types" />
<figcaption>Sample of Card Types</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Stacks are groupings of cards of different types — e.g., profile, video, gallery. Stacks are a good way to call attention to content that is relevant to the page the user is on. </p>

<p>How to add a stack:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose where you want to place a stack.</p></li>
<li><p>Add cards one at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the content for each card.</p></li>
</ol>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>If there’s important information you want users to see in a stack, set the card that contains that information to be a featured card.</li>
<li>Use a variety of card types when creating a stack.</li>
<li>By design, there is no maximum for the number of cards you may place in a stack. While there is not a required minimum, aim for at least three cards.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Tables</h4>

<figure>
<img src="assets/table.png" alt="Table Example" />
<figcaption>Table Example</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The table component is for adding tabular data to a page. Please note that the table should only be used for numerical-type information and not for organizing paragraphs; use tables for structured information.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

<ul>
<li>Do: use a table to show the tuition for degree programs for the upcoming academic year.</li>
<li>Don’t: use tables to list descriptions of different types of programs or organizations.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>How to Add a Table</h4>

<p>It’s a good idea to put your table in context with a title and any explanatory copy that will help users understand it. You can do that with the rich text component or an intro teaser.</p>

<p>Once you have added that text:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose Table from the component list.</li>
<li>Enter the number of rows and columns you’ll need. You can adjust this if you need to.</li>
<li>Enter the data into the table.</li>
</ol>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use the rich text component (or an intro teaser) to hold explanatory copy related to the table.</li>
<li>If you use column headers, make sure to have them on each column so the table displays properly on mobile.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use footnotes in the table or descriptive copy about the data. That info should be in the rich text or other component.</li>
<li>Tables can also be added inside the rich text component.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Teasers</h4>

<figure>
<img src="assets/teasers.png" alt="Sampling of Teasers" />
<figcaption>Sampling of Teasers</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Teasers are groupings of design elements that typically include an image or video, title, subtitle, and text. Some also include a call-to-action button. </p>

<p>There are several types of teasers, and you can use them in a variety of combinations. For example, create a five piece teaser unit by stacking a feature teaser above four teaser blocks.</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use teasers to organize page content into easy to scan areas rather than walls of text.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/teaser_intro.png" alt="Intro Teaser" />
<figcaption>Intro Teaser</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Intro Teaser</h4>

<p>Includes a title, subtitle and area for intro text. CTA buttons can be included as well. Use for introducing a page or section on a page. Combines well with the rich text component.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/teaser_feature.png" alt="Feature Teaser" />
<figcaption>Feature Teaser</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Feature Teaser</h4>

<p>Includes a title, subtitle, area for text, and spot for media (image, video or gallery). A CTA can be included as well. Works well as a stand-alone feature on a page to highlight a topic with media.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/teaser_block.png" alt="Teasers Block" />
<figcaption>Teasers Block</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Teasers</h4>

<p>Allows for up to four blocks that each include a title, short description, media and CTA. Use it to summarize a topic and lead users to more information. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-personalization">Personalization</h2>

<hr />

<p>The Guilford website includes a suite of very powerful personalization features. Used to their fullest, these features will make the website feel relevant and friendly for all types of visitors. Personalization also places Guilford College’s website on the leading edge of higher education sites.</p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/notes.png" alt="Guilford Notes" />
<figcaption>Guilford Notes</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Guilford Notes</h4>

<p>With Guilford Notes users can easily save pieces of content — sentences, even — and whole pages to their own digital notebook, and then return later to view the content again. </p>

<hr />

<figure>
<img src="assets/friendly_tips.png" alt="Friendly Tips" />
<figcaption>Friendly Tips</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Friendly Tips</h4>

<p>Friendly Tips are quick pieces of content (text, quotations, images) that can be added to the following components: </p>

<ul>
<li>Teasers</li>
<li>Feature Teaser</li>
<li>Intro Teaser</li>
</ul>

<p>Use tips to offer instructions or help to website users on or near a link or CTA. Tips are meant to be written as if a person is giving advice.</p>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>Use one or two tips per page. Tips are considered special when used sparingly.</li>
<li>Create friendly tips from students for student centered pages; and from parents for parents centered pages. Users like to receive advice from people with whom they can relate.</li>

<h4>Audience Aware Content</h4>

<p>The most ambitious — and unique — personalization feature allows Guilford to create and deploy audience-specific content on pages throughout the site. Basically, if you can programmatically identify a particular audience (i.e. set of users), then you can develop special, personalized content that only the target audience will see. Executing this feature well requires strategic content planning.</p>

<hr />

<h4>What can be personalized?</h4>

<p>The Page content type can be personalized, while departments, programs, events, articles, and profiles cannot. On normal pages, the following components can be made audience aware: header, intro teaser, feature teaser, and images. </p>

<hr />

<h5>Audience Tags</h5>

<p>We identify what type of user is viewing a page by reading what audience tags are in his or her browser. Users collect tags in three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By visiting pages on the site.</li>
<li>When the site automatically identifies their location (based on his or her computer’s IP address).</li>
<li>When users come in to the site from a specially created link (i.e. as part of a campaign).</li>
</ol>

<p>We have created three location segments into which we will sort all website visitors: </p>

<ul>
<li>In-state (inside North Carolina)</li>
<li>Out-of-state (outside North Carolina; inside USA)</li>
<li>International (outside of the USA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, all pages on the site will be tagged with one or more of the basic audiences groups we identified during our definition phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prospective Students</li>
<li>Current Students</li>
<li>Parents</li>
<li>Alumni</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h5>Displaying the Right Content</h5>

<p>Once an audience is defined, you can create content for it using the Audience Based Content component. You will need to write a default version of the component, along with any personalized versions. Site visitors who do not belong to one of your targeted audiences will see the default content. Follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose “Add — Audience Based Content” from the bottom of the edit screen.</li>
<li>Select which kind of content you will be personalizing by clicking on one of the content type buttons under the “Content Block Default” header. Fill in the content here. This will be the content that appears when no personalized content is being shown.</li>
<li>Click “Add — Content Block Version” to add a personalized version of the content block you just created.</li>
<li>Use the “Audience” field to choose from the predefined audience types. This determines which audience will see the content in this version.</li>
<li>Click a button to choose the same content type as the default version above. Fill in the content block.</li>
<li>Be sure to save your work.</li>
</ol>

<h6>TIPS</h6>

<ul>
<li>Target the most valuable audience segments. Don’t spend time creating custom content for relatively unimportant audiences.</li>
<li>A single page can have more than one audience aware component.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-imagespecs">Image Specifications</h2>

<hr />

<p>Minimal preparation is required when uploading images. For example, cropping is not necessary. </p>

<p>The site will automatically crop the image to fit the design and the screen size the user is visiting the site on. To ensure that auto cropping doesn’t cut off an important part of an image, you can select a focal point when uploading the image. The focal point won’t be cut off when an image needs to be cropped for viewing on smaller screens.</p>

<figure>
<img src="assets/focal_point.png" alt="Image thumbnail with focal point" />
<figcaption>Image thumbnail with focal point</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While you do not need to crop images before uploading, you should follow these size and aspect ratio guides. Please note that the sizes listed below are in a 2x format and will provide the best quality on devices with high resolution screens.</p>

<figcaption>Full-width and content-width images</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h4>About Parallax</h4>

<p>With parallax, images are arranged in the background, with section content overlaying it so content moves on top of the image as the user scrolls. To use this effect, set layout to “full” when adding your image.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="section-wordcounts">Word Counts</h2>

<p>Most components have a recommended word count to ensure that text fits properly. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Accordion</h3>

<p>Question: 10 - 15 words
Answer: No limit. But follow standard web writing practices. Be brief.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Factoid Blocks</h3>

<p>Title: 5 - 8 words
Subhead: 20 - 30 words</p>

<hr />

<h3>Rich Text/Body Copy</h3>

<p>There isn’t a limit to the number of words you can use for rich text or other text that would be considered “body copy” for things like bios, articles, etc.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that online readers scan more than read. This means that breaking text into chunks with headings will greatly help your audience find relevant information. Also, keep sentences short (20 to 25 words) and don’t be afraid to use single-sentence paragraphs. Newspapers are filled with them.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Smart Container</h3>

<p>Title: 8 - 10 words
Subhead: 5 - 10 words
Description: 10 &#8211;15 words</p>

<h2 id="section-createandedit">Creating and Editing Content</h2>

<p>The types of content and specific pages you have access to create and edit on the site is determined by things like your role — staff or faculty, for example — and how much writing and editing for the site is part of your job responsibilities. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHhD0tPKoLYSr0P3y8Sy1w1dLEIwoV3ozuo6i0ybEaM/edit?usp=sharing">Writing for the Web Editorial Style Guide</a></p>

<p>All content you create or edit for the website (regardless of your particular role) should follow the guidelines and tips in this editorial style guide. It is important to be familiar with what this document says about guilford.edu’s goals, audience, voice, copy style, and other topics before working on content for the website.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxctGGMAZuqfUnNaUGJvaktVODQ/view?usp=sharing">User Personas </a></p>

<p>Website writers and editors should also familiarize themselves with the user personas developed for the website. Have in mind these three fictional users when creating content. Does the material speak to one or more of them? Is your copy’s message something they would be interested in? Is your writing style — i.e. the words you use, your sentence structure — compatible with this audience?</p>

<hr />

<h4>Create a Form from a Template</h4>

<p>Follow these <a href="#section-generalsteps">general steps</a> to begin the form-creation process. Then follow these instructions and tips:</p>

<hr />

<h4>Provide Context</h4>

<p>Use the Header &gt; Overview section to include a sentence or two introduction about what the form is for. In a friendly manner, include any special instructions or important information the person completing the form should know.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Selecting the Form Template</h4>

<p>In the form tab begin entering the name of the form you want to use. </p>

<hr />

<h4>Build a Custom Form Template</h4>

<p>The site uses the YAML webform module which comes with template-style forms for a variety of common form types, e.g., registration. These templates can be used as a starting point to create custom forms. If you need to create a custom form and have access to the Structure &gt; YAML Forms section of the CMS, follow the instructions below. If you do not have access to that section, contact a site administrator.</p>

<p>To customize a form:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to Structure or Shortcut &gt; YAML form</p></li>
<li><p>Give the new form a title and description.</p></li>
<li><p>Customize the form by editing or deleting fields and adding new elements/fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Save elements to save the form. The form will now be available when using the Webform content type.</p></li>
</ol>

<h5>TIPS</h5>

<ul>
<li>To edit the confirmation message people see when they submit a form (a recommended step), go to the Settings tab of the form and edit the text in the confirmation settings box.</li>
<li>To see the types of fields/elements you can use, view the example forms.</li>
<li>The module supports emailing people who submit a form and other more advanced functionality. Learn more about <a href="http://yamlform.io/features/">YAML form features</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Managing Submissions</h4>

<p>To view, download or take other actions related to form submissions, go to the Results tab of a form.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-eventmanagement">Event Management</h4>

<p>The site uses the RNG module for managing event registration. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/rng">Learn more about the module</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-taxonomies">Taxonomies</h4>

<p>Taxonomies are used to manage things like the categories that programs appear under in the program finder. They are also used to manage categories for other types of content, such as articles and event types.</p>

<p>Taxonomies are also used to manage who can edit certain content on the site. The editorial sections taxonomy is one example.</p>

<p>To manage taxonomies, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<h5>TIP</h5>

<ul>
<li>If you want change the name of a term that is already used to categorize content, edit the term rather than delete and add a new term. This way you don’t have to retag the content with the updated term name.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-editorialaccess">Editorial Access and Workflows</h4>

<p>To control specific content (e.g. a particular page or program) a CMS user can edit, the site uses a module called Workbench and taxonomies. </p>

<p>The primary taxonomy that’s used to manage editing access to content is the Editorial Sections taxonomy. That taxonomy allows for the creation of groups such as Marketing or Admissions. CMS users are assigned to the various editorial sections created.</p>

<p>Certain content, such as pages, includes an editorial sections tab. In that tab you can select an editorial section. Users who are part of that editorial section can then edit the content, even if they did not originally create it. </p>

<p>An example:
The undergraduate academics page is tagged with the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane is a member of the Marketing and Communications editorial section. Jane can edit the undergraduate academics page even though she isn’t the original author.</p>

<p>To manage the editorial section taxonomy, go to Structure &gt; Taxonomy</p>

<p>To manage Workbench, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<hr />

<h4>Workbench</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2121239">Workbench</a> module manages publishing workflows and revisions. </p>

<p>Workbench can be configured to suit Guilford’s editorial needs. Some examples: When an admin creates a new page they can save and publish it immediately. When an editor creates a page and saves it, it is saved as a draft for review by an author who publishes it. When an editor wants to edit an existing page they create a new draft, save it, and an author publishes it or sends it back as a draft.</p>

<p>To configure Workbench settings, go to Configuration &gt; Workflow</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-rolesandpermissions">Roles and Permissions</h4>

<p>To control actions CMS users can take and the parts of the CMS they have access to, the site uses roles and permissions. </p>

<p>A “role” is a type of user, e.g., administrator, author, editor. A “permission” is a task that can be completed, e.g., publish a program, delete a page. </p>

<p>Users are allowed to perform tasks based on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned manually by administrators and automatically through the Guilford College data source used to authenticate users. Roles and permissions can be expanded and modified as needed. </p>

<p>To manage roles, go to People &gt; Roles</p>

<p>To manage permissions, go to People &gt; Permissions</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-metatags">Meta Tags/SEO</h4>

<p>To include information like page descriptions that search engines use to match users’ search queries with web content, the site uses the Meta Tags module.</p>

<p>To add a page description to a page or other piece of content, open the Meta Tags box (it will be on the right-hand side of the page if you’re on a desktop computer). Then enter the description.</p>

<p>You can also manage what’s shown when site content is shared on social networks like Facebook using the Meta Tags module.</p>

<p>The Meta Tags module includes many more ways to optimize content for search engines and social networks. Learn more about the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">Meta Tags module</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="section-managingfiles">Managing Images and Files</h4>

<p>When adding an image or file to a piece of content, users have the option to select images and files previously uploaded to the site. This can help when images or files need to be used frequently or in multiple places.</p>

<p>To manage the images and other files on the site, go to Content and open the Files tab.</p>
